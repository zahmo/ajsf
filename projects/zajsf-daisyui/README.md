# @zajsf/daisyui
This module is a dependency of the [zajsf project][npm_core_ver] and is meant to work as a framework installation module for using DaisyUI in the forms.

## Getting started

If you are unfamiliar with with the zajsf project, it is highly recommended to 
first have a look at the [@zajsf pages][npm_core_ver] for examples, demos, options and documentation.

## Getting started

```shell
npm install @zajsf/core@latest @zajsf/cssframework@latest @zajsf/daisyui@latest
```

With YARN, run the following:

```shell
yarn add @zajsf/core@latest @zajsf/cssframework@latest @zajsf/daisyui@latest
```

Then import `DaisyUIFrameworkModule` in your main application module if you want to use `daisyui` UI, like this:

```javascript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { DaisyUIFrameworkModule } from '@zajsf/daisyui';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [ AppComponent ],
  imports: [
    DaisyUIFrameworkModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [ AppComponent ]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

For basic use, after loading JsonSchemaFormModule as described above, to display a form in your Angular component, simply add the following to your component's template:

```html
<json-schema-form
  loadExternalAssets="true"
  [schema]="yourJsonSchema"
  framework="daisyui"
  [theme]="yourTheme"
  (onSubmit)="yourOnSubmitFn($event)">
</json-schema-form>
```

Where `schema` is a valid JSON schema object, and `onSubmit` calls a function to process the submitted JSON form data. If you don't already have your own schemas, you can find a bunch of samples to test with in the `demo/assets/example-schemas` folder, as described above.

`framework` is for the template you want to use, the default value is `no-framwork`. The possible values are:

* `material-design` for  Material Design (if installed).
* `bootstrap-3` for Bootstrap 3 (if installed).
* `bootstrap-4` for Bootstrap 4 (if installed).
* `bootstrap-5` for Bootstrap 5 (if installed).
* `daisyui` for DaisyUi. 
* `no-framework` for (plain HTML).

`theme` is for the framework theme you want to use. 
The possible values for this framework are:

* `daisyui_default` for the default theme.
* `light` for the light theme.
* `dark` for the dark theme.
* `cupcake` for the cupcake theme.
* `cmyk` for the cmyk theme.
* `pastel` for the pastel theme.
* `daisyui_leaf` for the leaf theme.

the list of available themes can also be gotten using the 
FrameworkLibraryService(found in '@zajsf/core'): 
 ```typescript
 getFrameworkThemes()
 ``` 
 method 

## Custom theming

Custom theming can be achieved in two ways:

* the simplest is to overwrite the default theme(or any other themes) with css rules:
css changes can be made using the `data-theme` attribute selector
so for example to change the .btn class of the default theme, you would
include the following rule in your application's styles

```css
[data-theme="daisyui_default"] .btn {
    border-radius: 1rem
}
```

* the other method is to add a new theme:
the first step will be to create the entire theme (see the specific frameworks underlying documentation for how this can be done) and have it use the `data-theme` attribute selector for example:

```css
[data-theme="daisyui_custom"] {
    background-color: green;
    font: 15px Arial, sans-serif;
    .
    .
    .
}
[data-theme="daisyui_custom"] .btn {
    border-color: coral;
    .
    .
    .
}

```
after making the css available, the theme will need to be registered using the  
FrameworkLibraryService(found in '@zajsf/core'):
for example 

```typescript
  constructor(
    .
    private frameworkLibrary: FrameworkLibraryService,
    .
    .
  ) { 

    frameworkLibrary.registerTheme({name:'daisyui_custom',text:'DaisyUi custom theme'})

  }

```

## Resolving conflicting css class names

In case your app already uses css class names used by the DaisyUI Framework for example '.btn', then it is possible to switch the framework's class names with prefixed ones. Instead of now using '.btn', the framework's class will be prefixed with 'dui-' making the class name
'.dui-btn'. In order to make the switch, the DUIOPTIONS token value needs to be provided with the classPrefix property set to true-see code snippet below. By default the classPrefix property is false however could be changed in the future, since it does mean that a client needs to know which css classes are in conflict.   

```typescript

import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import {DUIOPTIONS, DaisyUIFrameworkModule } from '@zajsf/daisyui';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [ AppComponent ],
  imports: [
    DaisyUIFrameworkModule
  ],
  providers: [
    { provide: DUIOPTIONS, useValue: {classPrefix:true} }
    ],
  bootstrap: [ AppComponent ]
})
export class AppModule { }

```

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project @zajsf/daisyui` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project @zajsf/daisyui`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project @zajsf/daisyui` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file.

## Build

Run `ng build @zajsf/daisyui` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test @zajsf/daisyui` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
